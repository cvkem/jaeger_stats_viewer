# Jaeger-stats-viewer

This viewer is used to visualize the aggregated statistics generated by the Jaeger-stats tool. It provides an ordere list of processes ranked based on growth-rates where the processes that grow fastest are on top. When a process is selected a series of metrics is shown on the lef-hand side of the page. These metrics are the aggregate over all traces in the sample that touch this specific process-operation combination.

Once you have selected a process on the left-hand side that requires further analysis you can drill-down to the call-chain level via the drop-down box on the ride hand side. This drill-down is limited to the full traces that run through the process-operation selected on the left. By full call-chains we maean call-changes that cover complete traces from start to end.

place the bin file in the src-tauri directory and run 'cargo update'
